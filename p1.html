			<h3>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do</h3>
			<p class="text-center">Hello everyone!  My name is Jared and I am currently working on earning my Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Harvard Extension School.  I have a BS in Mathematics from UCONN and currently work at a non-profit helping house homeless individuals and families in the Boston area but am looking to further my education and enter the computer science field.</p>
			<h3>Why are you taking this course?</h3>
			<p>I'm taking this course currently to fulfill requirements for the Master's Degree in Software Engineering from the Harvard Extension school.  But besides that I thought that this course was a great opportunity to delve a bit more into web-based programming compared to courses I've taken in the past.</p>
			<h3>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h3>
			<p>I learned some HTML and CSS when I was in high school but it wasn't until last semester where I took CS50 online through Harvard Extension School where I acquired most of my knowledge.</p>
			<h3>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
			<p>As I stated for the previous question, I took CS50 last semester and had a crash course in a few different programming languages.  Most of the class was focused around writing and compiling in C but we also worked with PHP and JavaScript.  I've also used online tutorials to familiarize myself with other languages such as Python or Ruby, but have not developed and larger projects with those languages.</p>
			<h3>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h3>
			<p>I did work with PHP a fair amount in CS50 as one of our homework assignments worked with PHP.  In the assignment we wrote PHP code in conjunction with HTML to create a website that was able query a mySQL database to manipulate data.  We also used PHP to obtain stock information from Yahoo Finance and to email the users.</p>
			<h3>Describe your level of experience with programming.</h3>
			<p>As I stated in my answers for some of the previous questions I have a fair amount of experience with programming but absolutely still consider myself a beginner.  I hope to be able to combine my previous programming experience along with my strong Mathematics background to create some interesting web applications in this class!</p>
			<h3>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
			<p>I primarily use a PC for my coding but have experience with Linux/Unix and may use that platform from time to time.</p>
			<h3>Anything else we should know?</h3>
			<p>I live in Somerville and I enjoy music and riding my bike!  Feel free to email me or contact me on Piazza!</p>
